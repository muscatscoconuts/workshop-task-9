# workshop notes
using the webcam as the image
- use scale to make everything work smoother and faster
- can use pixel manipulation on live images - combine with objects
# workshop task
i wanted to revisit the walkers from task 7 because i really like they way they are animated. i replaced the stroke values with the getPixel values and then let it do its thing, as well as a few other parts of the code. I want to try some more stuff with the webcam footage, and see what other things from other tasks i could combine together with it. I am learning that it is very handy to copy/paste and reuse code you've alread written.
